title: Migrating to TanStack Query Firebase
description: Migrating from the old React Query Firebase to the new TanStack Query Firebase.
---

The initial version of this project was called `React Query Firebase`, and built upon the
older versions of *React Query*. Over the past couple of years, there's been many changes
to the React Query library. 

The most substantial change was renaming the libray from *React Query* to *TanStack Query*.

The change brought about support for a wide array of framework support beyond React, including
Vue, Solid, Angular, and Svelte. The API has also evolved during this time, with many improvements
and new features.

The Firebase API also evolved during this time, with new services such as Data Connect and the migration 
from the compat API to the modular API.

## react-query-firebase

The `react-query-firebase` package was built to support React only, and was tightly coupled to
the older versions of React Query. For example, the `react-query-firebase` NPN namespace allowed you
to install a package per Firebase service, such as `@react-query-firebase/firestore`.

Additionally, the API was designed to work with the older React Query API of supporting positional args 
vs the newer object-based API:

```tsx
useFirestoreQuery(["products"]);
// vs
useFirestoreQuery({ queryKey: ["products"] });
```

## tanstack-query-firebase

The `tanstack-query-firebase` package is built to support all frameworks which TanStack Query supports,
although initially only React is supported.

Altough still in development, the API is designed to work with the newer object-based API of TanStack Query,
and also supports newer Firebase services such as Data Connect.

### Realtime Subscription Issues

Firebase supports realtime event subscriptions for many of its services, such as Firestore, Realtime Database and
Authentication.

The `react-query-firebase` package had a [limitation](https://github.com/invertase/tanstack-query-firebase/issues/25) whereby the hooks
would not resubscribe whenever a component re-mounted.

The initial version of `tanstack-query-firebase` currently opts-out of any realtime subscription hooks. This issue will be re-addressed
once the core API is stable supporting all Firebase services.

## Migration Steps

Follow the steps below to migrate your application from `react-query-firebase` to `tanstack-query-firebase`:

### 1. Install the new packages

Due to the restructure of the package namespace, you will need to install the new packages:

```bash
npm i --save firebase @tanstack/react-query @tanstack-query-firebase/react
```

Remove any existing `@react-query-firebase/*` packages from your `package.json`.

### 2. Update your imports

Update any imports for your `react-query-firebase` hooks to the new `tanstack-query-firebase` hooks, for example for Firestore:

```diff
- import { useFirestoreDocument } from '@react-query-firebase/firestore';
+ import { useDocumentQuery } from '@tanstack-query-firebase/react/firestore';
```

### 3. Update your usage

The older API followed the positional args pattern, whereas the new API follows the object-based pattern. Update your hooks to use the new pattern:

```diff
- useFirestoreDocument(["products"], ref);
+ useDocumentQuery(ref, {
+   queryKey: ["products"],
+ });
```
