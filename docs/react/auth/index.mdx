title: Firebase Authentication
---

## Setup

Before using the Tanstack Query Firebase hooks for Authentication, ensure you have configured your Firebase application
to setup an Auth instance:

```ts
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

// Initialize your Firebase app
initializeApp({ ... });

// Get the Auth instance
const auth = getAuth(app);
```

## Importing

The package exports are available via the `@tanstack-query-firebase/react` package under the `auth` namespace:

```ts
import { useSignOutMutation } from "@tanstack-query-firebase/react/auth";
```
